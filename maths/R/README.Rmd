Through this tutorial you will learn how to use R from your local machine or from one of the [UL HPC platform](http://hpc.uni.lu) clusters.
Then, we will see how to organize and group data. Finally we will illustrate how R can benefit from multicore and cluster parallelization.

Warning: this tutorial does not focus on the learning of R language but aims at showing you nice start-up tips.
If you're also looking for a good tutorial on R's data structures you can take a look at: [Hadley Wickham's page](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html).
Another [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)'s book  is available for free: [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) by Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham

## Pre-requisites ##

Ensure you are able to [connect to the UL HPC clusters](https://hpc.uni.lu/users/docs/access.html)

**you MUST work on a computing node**

~~~bash
# /!\ FOR ALL YOUR COMPILING BUSINESS, ENSURE YOU WORK ON A COMPUTING NODE
(access-iris)$> si --time=0:30:0 -N 1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --cpus-per-task=2 --mem-per-cpu 4096
~~~


### Optional: On your local machine

First of all, let's install R. You will find releases for various distributions available at [CRAN Archive](http://cran.r-project.org/).
Once installed, to use R interactive session interface, simply open a terminal and type:

    jdoe@localhost:~$ R

You will also find handy to use the [R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) graphical IDE. R-Studio embeds a R shell where you can call R functions as in the interactive session interface.
Thus you can use whether R interactive shell or R-Studio embedded shell.

### Installing R Packages

To install libraries you can use the `install.packages()` function. _e.g_


`install.packages("tidyverse")`

This will install the core packages of the `tidyverse`, including `ggplot2` and `dplyr`.

Note: on the first run, R might ask you various questions during the installation. e.g. selecting a CRAN mirror to use for downloading packages. Select a mirror close to your location. For other questions, using default values is ok.

Now, to load packages with a `library()` call:

`library(ggplot2)`

<a name="datasaurus"></a>

## Beginner session -- dataSaurus

in R or Rstudio do `install.packages("tidyverse")` (takes some time)

instructions: [in this tutorial](https://rworkshop.uni.lu/practicals/practical01_datasauRus_solution.html)

<a name="aggreg"></a>

## Comparing methods for aggregating data -- diamonds

Let's say we are working with the full `diamonds` dataset (supplied by the `ggplot2` package) and we want to compute the **average** price for a given diamond **cut**.

This dataset is not small:

```{r}
dim(diamonds)
```

before computing the average price per **cut**, we should explore the dataset. We won't use the ggplot's function `geom_point()` as there are too many dots.
However, binning the data is fast and still provide an idea of where the majority of dots are with a chosen lost of precision (number of **bins**, set to 30 by default).

From previous plots, we know the relationship between carat and price is linear in the log-space. All those computation can be done by `ggplot2`

Of note: you need to install the package `hexbin`

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  # bin data into 30 sets
  geom_hex(aes(x = carat, y = price), bins = 30) +
  # split per cut
  facet_wrap(~ cut) +
  # log transform both axes
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  # add logsticks to bottom and left
  annotation_logticks(side = "bl") +
  # viridis is so much better than the default blue gradient
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal(14)
#ggsave(file = "diamonds_plot.pdf", last_plot(), width = 8, height = 4)
```

<a name="aggreg_speed"></a>

### Speed comparison of different tools for aggregating data

We could do a for loop to aggregate the data per cuts and manually compute the average price,
but in R loops are generally a bad idea ([if you avoid growing vectors there are fine](https://privefl.github.io/blog/why-loops-are-slow-in-r/)) and:

[![](https://rworkshop.uni.lu/lectures/img/07/for_loops.png)](https://rworkshop.uni.lu/lectures/lecture07_purrr.html#20)

It is better to concentrate on actions and not on programming, so the looping can be efficiently done internally.

Thus instead of looping around the dataset, we will use a function from the `dplyr` package part of the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org) idiom

<a name="aggreg_dplyr"></a>

#### `dplyr` from the tidyverse


First of all, we chain the commands using the **pipe** _%>%_. That avoids many parenthesis and keep the natural reading from left to right. Of note, the pipe `|>` will come in R base with the next version, **4.1**.

The first parameter will be the dataset, the second will be the column of the dataset we want to group the results on,
third parameter will be the call to the `summarise()` function that will enable to aggregate data on the `cut` column.


```{r}
library(dplyr)
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarise(avg_price = mean(price))
```


Note: `summarise()` from the `dplyr` package is similar to `aggregate()` from base package,
`dplyr` functions simply provide a more consistent naming convention together with better performance

<a name="aggreg_base"></a>

#### `aggregate` from base

```{r}
aggregate(price ~ cut,
          FUN = mean,
          data = diamonds)
```

### `lapply` from base

In the previous example we used `aggregate` for the **aggregation**, we could also have used `lapply` (but in a more complex way):


```{r}
as.data.frame(cbind(cut = as.character(unique(diamonds$cut)), 
                    avg_price = lapply(unique(diamonds$cut), 
                                       function(x) {
                                         mean(diamonds$price[which(diamonds$cut == x)])
                    })))
```

<a name="aggreg_dt"></a>

#### `data.table`

[**data.table**](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Getting-started) is a package without dependencies that is super fast.
Although the syntax is harder to learn compared to `dplyr`, if speed is your concern, it is your go-to package. See this long thread [at stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21435339/data-table-vs-dplyr-can-one-do-something-well-the-other-cant-or-does-poorly) for a comparison of both tools.

```{r}
# install.package("data.table")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(data.table))
DT <- data.table(diamonds)
DT[, mean(price), by = cut]
```

<a name="aggreg_bench"></a>

#### benchmarks

So, we want to know which one of the two versions is the most efficient, for that purpose, the package `bench` is handy.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("bench")
```


The `mark()` function performs x times the calls of several expressions, grabbing its performance (time and ressources used)


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(bench)
set.seed(123)
m <- bench::mark(LAPPLY    = as.data.frame(cbind(cut = as.character(unique(diamonds$cut)),
                                                 price = lapply(unique(diamonds$cut), function(x) mean(diamonds$price[which(diamonds$cut == x)])))),
                 AGGREGATE = aggregate(price ~ cut, FUN = mean, data = diamonds),
                 DPLYR     = group_by(diamonds, cut) %>% summarise(price = mean(price)),
                 DATATABLE = DT[, list(price = mean(price)), by = cut],
                 iterations = 100, check = FALSE)
```

- makes comparison easier to read using **relative** values. `1` for the fastest.

```{r}
summary(m, relative = TRUE)
```

- plotting the benchmark

You can use `ggplot2` via the `autoplot()` function

```{r}
autoplot(m)
```


<a name="hpc"></a>

## Parallel computing using HPC

**R** is already available on `iris` clusters as a module. The current production version is `3.6.0`.
The first step is the reservation of a resource. Connect to your favorite cluster frontend (here: `iris`). We assume you have already configured your `.ssh/config`.

#### iris

    jdoe@localhost:~$ ssh iris-cluster

Once connected to the user frontend, book **4** cores for half an hour

    [jdoe@access2 ~]$ si --time=0:30:0 -N 1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --cpus-per-task=4 --mem-per-cpu 4096

When the job is running and you are connected load _R_ module (so version `3.6.0`).

    [jdoe@access2 ~]$ module load lang/R


Now you should be able to invoke R and see something like this:

    [jdoe@iris-081 ~]$  R

    R version 3.6.0 (2019-04-26) -- "Planting of a Tree"
    Copyright (C) 2019 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
    Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

    [...]
    Type 'q()' to quit R.
    >

<a name="hpc_pkg"></a>

### mandatory packages

The core package we are going to use is [`future`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future) by [Henrik Bengtsson](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson).

The main idea is to run expressions **asynchronously**. Future expressions are run according to _plan_ defined by the user.

for the last section, you need to install the following packages, `future`, `furrr` and `Rstne`

```
module load lang/R/3.6.0-intel-2019a-bare
```

you will a warning because it hasn't been fully tested yet.

After entering R using the `R` command, install both packages. Don't forget to use multi-threading for the compilations.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("future", "furrr", "purrr", "dplyr", "dbscan", "tictoc", "Rtsne"),
                 repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com", Ncpus = 4)
```

quit by typing `quit()` and `n` do not save workspace image (actually, this should be your default).

The [`furrr` package](https://davisvaughan.github.io/furrr/) by David Vaughan is a nice wrapper around `future` and `purrr`, the functional programming idiom of the tidyverse.

<a name="hpc_toy"></a>

### toy example

Run a dumb loop on 3 times **2** that wait for those values

- first sequentially

```{r}
library(furrr)
plan(sequential)
tictoc::tic()
nothingness <- future_map(c(2, 2, 2), ~ Sys.sleep(.x), .progress = TRUE)
tictoc::toc()
```

- second in parallel

```{r}
plan(multisession)
tictoc::tic()
nothingness <- future_map(c(2, 2, 2), ~ Sys.sleep(.x), .progress = TRUE)
tictoc::toc()
```


fetch env variables in R

`as.integer(Sys.getenv("SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK"))`

<a name="hpc_tsne"></a>

### t-SNE example

Now, let's try with a real example. Using some data supplied as a R object.

Create both the `R` and `bash` script in a folder (likely your `scratch` partition).

#### R script

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(furrr)
library(Rtsne)

# check the path of pkgs
.libPaths()
# see how many cores are going to be used
availableCores()
# load data
tSNEdata <- readRDS("/scratch/users/aginolhac/renv/tSNEdata.rds")
# create a partial function with filled arguments
short_tsne <- purrr::partial(Rtsne, X = tSNEdata, pca_center = TRUE,
                            theta = 0.5, pca_scale = TRUE, verbose = TRUE, max_iter = 300)

plan(multiprocess)

tictoc::tic(msg = "tsne")
tsne_future <- tibble(perplexities = seq(10, 110, by = 5)) %>%
                 # quietly captures outputs
                 mutate(model = future_map(perplexities, ~quietly(short_tsne)(perplexity = .x), .progress = FALSE))
tictoc::toc()


tictoc::tic("finding clusters")
res_tib <- mutate(tsne_future,
                  # unlist and extract the 2D matrix
                  Y = map(model, pluck, "result", "Y"),
                  # convert to a dataframe
                  Y_df = map(Y, as.data.frame),
                  # for clustering, parallelise since expensive step
                  cluster = future_map(Y_df, dbscan::hdbscan, minPts = 200),
                  # extract from hdbscan object only the cluster info
                  c = map(cluster, pluck, 1),
                  # iterate though the 2D coordinates and cluster info to merge them
                  tsne = map2(Y_df, c, ~ bind_cols(.x, tibble(c = .y))),
                  # extract the output of tsne runs if needed to be parsed
                  output = map_chr(model, pluck, "output"))
tictoc::toc()

saveRDS(res_tib, "tsne_future.rds")
```

save as file named **tsne.R**


#### launcher for 10 minutes on one full node (28 cores)

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH -J tsne_hpc
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH -c 28
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --time=0-00:10:00
#SBATCH -p batch
#SBATCH --qos=normal

echo "== Starting run at $(date)"
echo "== Job ID: ${SLURM_JOBID}"
echo "== Node list: ${SLURM_NODELIST}"
echo "== Submit dir. : ${SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR}"

# use version 3.6.0 and load the GNU toolchain
module load swenv/default-env/devel
module load lang/R/3.6.0-intel-2019a-bare

# prevent sub-spawn, 28 cores -> 28 processes
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1

Rscript tsne.R > job_${SLURM_JOB_NAME}.out 2>&1
```

save as file named **launcher.sh**. It requests a full node of **28** cores

#### Run the job


on the `iris` frontend, in the folder where both the **tsne.R** and **launcher.sh** files are located, type the `slurm` command:

```
sbatch launcher.sh
```

you can monitor the queue line with:

```
squeue -l -u $USER
```

When your _passive_ job has started, you can connect to the assigned node using the `sjoin` command on the frontend by Valentin Plugaru, use <TAB> to autocomplete the correct job and node ids.

Once logged in, you can check that the job is indeed run using the 28 cores as the output of `htop` below


![](img/htop_28cores.png)

and that they are dully full processes

![](img/htop_processes.png)


`furrr` allows to simply change your `map()` functions to `future_map()` to run in parallel. `future` takes in charge all the spawning and fetching of the processes.

it should give the following timing, looking at the `job_tsne_hpc.out` file:

```
tsne: 16.103 sec elapsed
finding clusters: 2.395 sec elapsed
```


##### trying the sequential version

- remove the `future` calls

`sed 's/future_map/map/' tsne.R > tsne_nofuture.R`

- adapt launcher script

`sed 's/tsne.R/tsne_nofuture.R/' launcher.sh > launcher_nofuture.sh`

- submit the job

`sbatch launcher_nofuture.sh`

- new timing, same `job_tsne_hpc.out` file:

```
tsne: 214.913 sec elapsed
finding clusters: 28.043 sec elapsed
```


#### Conclusion

see below the benefit of using more cores on the elapsed time for computationally intensive tasks such as t-SNE (code in [`furrr_benchmark.Rmd`](https://github.com/ULHPC/tutorials/blob/devel/maths/R/furrr_benchmark.Rmd))

![](img/furrr_tsne.png)

#### Animation

just for the fun of it, using the [gganimate](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate) package, we can visualise how the t-SNE evolves with increasing perplexities

![](img/tsne_110_component.gif)


If of interest, the code it as follows (install required for `gganimate`, `gifski`):

Beware, the animating takes ~ 4 minutes to complete.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(gganimate)

res <- read_rds("tsne_future.rds")

res %>%
  rename(cdbl = c) %>%
  filter(perplexities %in% seq(10, 110, 20)) %>%
  unnest(tsne) %>%
  select(-output) %>%
  group_by(perplexities) %>%
  mutate(n = row_number()) -> tib_light

tictoc::tic("tweening")
tib_light %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = V1, y = V2, group = n, colour = factor(c))) +
  geom_point(data = function(x) filter(x, c == 0), colour = "grey50", alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_point(data = function(x) filter(x, c != 0), alpha = 0.6) +
  transition_states(perplexities, transition_length = 5, state_length = 1) +
  ease_aes('cubic-in-out') +
  labs(title = "perplexities: {closest_state}") +
  labs(colour = "cluster") +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_minimal(14) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") -> tib_anim
tictoc::toc()
tictoc::tic("animate")
tib_gif <- animate(tib_anim, nframes = 200, fps = 10)
tictoc::toc()
tib_gif
anim_save("tsne_200.gif", tib_gif)
```

### Reading data

For the t-SNE example, we cheated a bit by loading a R compressed object I prepared in advance (`.rds`).
It was convenient because loading was fast and the columns and numbers were correctly read.

In real life though, most dataset come as text files with some delimiters. Now we can load the equivalent of the t-SNE data as a `.csv` file and benchmarks the main tools for this step.

- `read.csv()` is the base function. Turns out to be slow for large files.
- [`fread()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table/versions/1.12.2/topics/fread) is the fantastic and fast import function from `data.table`
- [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) is the tidyverse way of reading a csv. Fast than base, slower than `data.table`.
- `vroom()` is the recent [package](http://vroom.r-lib.org/articles/vroom.html) that could be the next standard for reading files in the tidyverse dialect. Check the [benchmarks](http://vroom.r-lib.org/articles/benchmarks.html) for a detailed comparison. It uses the [ALTREP](https://purrple.cat/blog/2018/10/14/altrep-and-cpp/) introduced in R `3.5.0` that allows to delay actual reading data, making it super fast. Materialization of data comes when you need the exact column and rows.

Here we will benchmark reading only numbers since it is a matrix of doubles.

In your session on `iris`, in the R console,

- first install required packages

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("vroom", "ggplot2", "cowplot", "data.table", "readr", "bench", "ggbeeswarm"), Ncpus = 4)
```

paste the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)

# must set thread by hand since parallel::detectCores() will detect 28.
# overhead will be bad for the performance
Sys.setenv(VROOM_THREADS = as.integer(Sys.getenv("SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK")))
# must be 4
as.integer(Sys.getenv("VROOM_THREADS"))

tSNEdata_location <- "tSNEdata.csv"
bench::mark(base = read.csv(tSNEdata_location),
            readr = readr::read_csv(tSNEdata_location, col_types = cols(), progress = FALSE),
            data.table = data.table::fread(tSNEdata_location),
            dat_vroom = vroom::vroom(tSNEdata_location, col_types = cols(), progress = FALSE),
            dat_vroom_altrep = vroom::vroom(tSNEdata_location, altrep_opts = TRUE, col_types = cols(), progress = FALSE),
            check = FALSE, iterations = 50) -> m
# show tables, absolute and relative
m
summary(m, relative = TRUE)
# create a plot of both speed and memory allocations, align the vertical lines
p <- cowplot::plot_grid(autoplot(m),
                        m %>%
                          tidyr::unnest() %>%
                          filter(gc == "none") %>%
                          mutate(expression = as.character(expression)) %>%
                          ggplot(aes(x = mem_alloc, y = time, color = expression)) +
                          geom_point() +
                          theme_minimal(14), ncol = 1, align = "v")
# save as pdf
ggsave("csv_benchmarks.pdf", p, width = 8)

`vroom` is multi-threaded and will use the 4 cores and performed similarly as `data.table` which was designed to be efficient for **numeric** data, see the [benchmarks](http://vroom.r-lib.org/articles/benchmarks.html) done by the author [Jim Hester](https://github.com/jimhester) (also maintainer of `readr`).


### Enclosed R packages environment

this package is still under development but is the promising replacement for `packrat`.
Here is some instructions extracted from the [overview vignette](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)

- installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("renv")
```
