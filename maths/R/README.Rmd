Through this tutorial you will learn how to use R from your local machine or from one of the [UL HPC platform](https://hpc.uni.lu) clusters.
Then, we will see how to organize and group data. Finally we will illustrate how R can benefit from multicore and cluster parallelization.

Warning: this tutorial does not focus on the learning of R language but aims at showing you nice start-up tips.
If you're also looking for a good tutorial on R's data structures you can take a look at: [Hadley Wickham's page](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html).
Another [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)'s book  is available for free: [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) by Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham



--------------------

## Pre-requisites 

Ensure you are able to [connect to the UL HPC clusters](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/connect/ssh/)

**you MUST work on a computing node**

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
# /!\ FOR ALL YOUR COMPILING BUSINESS, ENSURE YOU WORK ON A COMPUTING NODE
(access-aion)$> si -c 2 -t 1:00:00
```

### Optional: On your local machine

First of all, let's install R. You will find releases for various distributions available at [CRAN Archive](http://cran.r-project.org/).

You will also find handy to use the [R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) graphical IDE.

### On HPC, available as a module

```bash
module load lang/R
```

We also need `pandoc`, supplied in RStudio but not on HPC.

We fetch the binary and copied in our own `~/bin` that should be included in your `PATH`.

```bash
wget -qO- https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/2.16.1/pandoc-2.16.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xfz - 
mkdir -p ~/bin/
cp cp pandoc-2.16.1/bin/pandoc ~/bin/
```

### Cloning

1. If you haven't cloned the [`tutorials`](https://github.com/ULHPC/tutorials) repository, do it with `git clone https://github.com/ULHPC/tutorials.git`

2. In your cloned [`tutorials`](https://github.com/ULHPC/tutorials) repository, `cd tutorials/maths/R`

3. Open a R session `jdoe@localhost:~$ R` or create a New Project in RStudio

### Enclosed R packages environment

We will use [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to synchronize the 
practical packages with yours. Having a dedicated library project allows to retrieve a certain specific set
without messing other projects


Of note, the `.Rprofile` is detected when `R` is started in the `tutorials/maths/R` folder and should see automatic boostraping of `renv`:

```r
# Bootstrapping renv 0.14.0 --------------------------------------------------
* Downloading renv 0.14.0 ... OK (downloaded source)
* Installing renv 0.14.0 ... Done!
* Successfully installed and loaded renv 0.14.0.
* Project '/mnt/lscratch/users/aginolhac/tutorials/maths/R' loaded. [renv 0.14.0]
* The project library is out of sync with the lockfile.
* Use `renv::restore()` to install packages recorded in the lockfile.
Warning message:
Project requested R version '4.1.0' but '4.0.5' is currently being used
```

Otherwise:

4. Install `renv`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("renv")
```

Then, restore the package list locally:

5. Restore the packages set for this practical

```{r, eval = FALSE}
renv::restore()
```

The list is prompted:

```r
[...]
# GitHub =============================
- tarchetypes      [* -> ropensci/tarchetypes@main]
- targets          [* -> ropensci/targets@main]

Do you want to proceed? [y/N]: 
```

Enter `y` and wait (takes 5 to 10 minutes)

The packages will be copied in a local cache, shared across projects.
So the same package installed in another folder is only linked, saving a lot of time while preserving the enclosed packages environments.

It takes time but who is really using R with `base` only?

6. Run `targets` for the **datasauRus** example

Either knitr in RStudio the file `datasauRus.Rmd` or run `rmarkdown::render("datasauRus.Rmd")` in a console.


7. Run `targets` for the **gapminder** example

Either knitr in RStudio the file `gapminder.Rmd` or run `rmarkdown::render("gapminder.Rmd")` in a console.

- `gapminder.html` document both the pipeline description and run
- `report_gap.html` was dynamically rendered

7bis. Try to set the multi-process on using `future`

Un-comment the lines
```r
library(future)
#library(future.callr)
#plan(callr)
```

and replace `tar_make()` by 

```r
tar_make_future(workers = 2)
```

8. Re-Knit `gapminder.Rmd`, all targets are skipped.

9. Modify one value in `gapminder.tsv` the raw data and Re-knit `gapminder.Rmd`

10. Change the linear regression for `lifeExp ~ year1950 + gdpPercap` and Re-knit `gapminder.Rmd`
