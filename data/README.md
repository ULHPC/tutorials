**Note:** To make it clear where you should execute a certain command, the prompt is prefixed with the location, i.e.

- `(access)$>` for commands on the cluster access/login nodes
- `(node)$>` for commands on a cluster node inside a job
- `(laptop)$>` for commands locally on your machine

The actual command comes only after this prefix.

## Overview

### Requirements

* Access to the UL HPC clusters.
* Basic knowledge of the linux command-line.

### Questions

* How can I check the my quotas on file sizes and number of files?
* What do "soft quota", "hard quota" and "grace period" mean?
* How can I see how much space is used on a specific file system?
* How can I compute checksums?
* How can I verify checksums?
* How can I encrypt a file?
* How can I decrypt a file?
* How can I encrypt a directory of files?
* How can I read the files in an encrypted directory?

### Objectives

* Explain the `df` and `df-ulhpc` commands to check disk usage and quota status.
* Compute MD5 and SHA-256 checksums and understand the difference between them.
* Verify MD5 and SHA-256 checksums.
* Encrypt a single file with GPG.
* Decrypt a GPG-encrypted file.
* Encrypt a whole folder with gocryptfs.
* Mount a gocryptfs-encrypted folder to read and write files in it.
* Unmount a gocryptfs-encrypted folder to secure it from unauthorized access.

## Preliminaries

Connect to the cluster.

## Quotas

We provide the `df-ulhpc` command on the cluster login nodes, which displays current usage, soft quota, hard quota and grace period. Any directories that have exceeded the quota will be highlighted in red.

Check your file size quota with:

```bash
(access)$> df-ulhpc
```

You will see a list of directories on which quotas are applied, how much space you are currently using, your soft quota, hard quota and the grace period.

Once your usage reaches the soft quota you can still write data until the grace period expires (7 days) or you reach the hard quota. After you reach the end of the grace period or the hard quota, you have to reduce your usage to below the soft quota to be able to write data again.

Check your inode quota with:

```bash
(access)$> df-ulhpc -i
```

Check the free space on all file systems with:

```bash
(access)$> df -h
```

Check the free space on the current file system with:

```bash
(access)$> cd
(access)$> df -h .
(access)$> cd /mnt/isilon/projects
(access)$> df -h .
```

To see what directories are using your disk space and quota:

```bash
(access)$> cd
(access)$> ncdu
```

## Checksums

> Integrity of data files is critical for the verifiability of computational and lab-based analyses. The way to seal a data file's content at a point in time is to generate a checksum. Checksum is a small sized datum generated by running an algorithm, called a cryptographic hash function, on a file. As long as a data file does not  change, the calculation of the checksum will always result in the same datum. If you recalculate the checksum and it is different from a past calculation, then you know the file has been **altered** or **corrupted** in some way.
>
> Below are typical situations that call for checksum generation:
>
>- A data file has been newly downloaded or received from a collaborator.
>- You have copied data files to a new storage location, for instance you moved data from local computer to HPC to start an analysis. You want to create a snapshot of your data, for instance when you’re creating a supplementary material folder for a paper/report.

### MD5

> The **MD5 message-digest algorithm** is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional corruption.
> 
> &mdash; <cite>[Wikipedia - MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5)</cite>

> (...) it should not be relied on if there is a chance that  files have been purposefully and maliciously tampered. In the latter case, the use of a newer hashing tool such as [sha256sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha256sum) is recommended.
> 
> &mdash; <cite>[Wikipedia - Md5sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5sum)</cite>

First, we need to start an interactive job and prepare some test data:

```bash
(access)$> si
(node)$> mkdir -p $SCRATCH/data_management
(node)$> cd $SCRATCH/data_management
(node)$> echo 'Happy secure computing!' > message.txt
```

We can create the MD5 checksum with the following command:

```bash
(node)$> md5sum message.txt
05babfa77d503a60561ceab31d767b34  message.txt
```

Since we want to store the checksum, we should save to a file:

```bash
(node)$> md5sum message.txt > message.md5
```

Given a data file and its checksum, you can **verify** the file against the checksum with the following command:

```bash
(node)$> md5sum -c message.md5
message.txt: OK
```

Let us change the file and see what happens to the checksum:

```bash
(node)$> echo "This file has been changed." >> message.txt
(node)$> md5sum message.txt
ebaf49a0b2482da084bca535db0423ba  message.txt
(node)$> md5sum -c message.md5
message.txt: FAILED
md5sum: WARNING: 1 computed checksum did NOT match
```

### SHA

SHA is short for Secure Hash Algorithm. There are several versions of SHA that have been developed over time: SHA-1, SHA-2 and SHA-3. SHA-2 is a whole family of algorithms that create hash values of different lengths.

The most commonly used version and the one recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is SHA-256, which creates a hash value of 256 bits. 

We can create the SHA-256 checksum with the following command:

```bash
(node)$> sha256sum message.txt > message.sha256
```

We can verify the file against the checksum similar to above:

```bash
(node)$> sha256sum -c message.sha256
message.txt: OK
```

## Encryption

Encryption is an effective measure to protect sensitive data.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:**

* Encryption keys and passphrases need to be kept safe and protected from unauthorised access.
* Loosing your encryption key means loosing your data.
* Ensure you have an off-site backup of critical data stored on the platform under encryption.
* (Disaster) recovery of encrypted data is not guaranteed to be viable, depending on internal consistency when the recovery snapshot is taken.

Note that any use of user-level encryption remains under the responsability of the user, with her/him accepting any inherent risks, such as:

- loss of access to data due to loss of decryption password/keys
- data corruption due to encryption store corruption, or improper use of the encryption tools

### GPG

We can encrypt our test file using GPG with the following command:

```bash
(node)$> gpg -c message.txt
```

Since you did not specify with what to encrypt your file, GPG will ask for a passphrase. Enter twice the same passphrase and make sure you remember it (in this case at least until the next step).

This command will also prompt GPG to generate a keyring, if you do not have one yet. The passphrase will be cached for the current SSH session.

This will create the encrypted file `message.txt.gpg` next to the unencrypted file, so let us delete the unencrypted file:

```bash
(node)$> rm message.txt
```

You can decrypt the file  with the following command:

```bash
(node)$> gpg message.txt.gpg
gpg: CAST5 encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
```

You will see some output telling you that the file was encrypted with [CAST5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAST-128) and a warning that it was not integrity protected.

To avoid that warning and since CAST5 is an older algorithm, let us encrypt the file with a newer and stronger algorithm:

```bash
(node)$> rm message.txt.gpg
(node)$> gpg --cipher-algo AES256 -c message.txt
(node)$> rm message.txt
(node)$> gpg message.txt.gpg
gpg: AES256 encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
```

#### Optional

Instead of using a passphrase, you can also encrypt files using an encryption key. You create an encryption key with GPG using the following command:

```bash
(node)$> gpg --gen-key
```

Keep in mind that DSA keys are deprecated, so you should generate a RSA key, ideally with 4096 bits. You will have to enter a couple of other details and then the key will be stored in the keyring.

You can list the contents of your keyring with

```bash
(node)$> gpg --list-keys
```

If you are going to transfer the data to someone else, you want to encrypt the data with the public key of the recipient, though, and not your own key. You can upload (the public) keys to public repositories for easier sharing. 

You can export your key to a file with:

```bash
(node)$> gpg --output jane-doe.key --armor --export jane.doe@uni.lu
```

Make sure to replace `jane-doe` with your name and use the email address that you specified when generating the key.

You can import other keys to your keyring using the following command:

```bash
(node)$> gpg --import jane-doe.key
```

To encrypt using a key, you must specify the email address associated to the key you want to use as recipient:

```bash
(node)$> gpg --encrypt --sign --recipient jane.doe@uni.lu message.txt
```

### Gocryptfs

Gocryptfs is a modern implementation of an encryption overlay filesystem.

For more details on its inner workings, see the following:

- [Security design documentation](https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/forward_mode_crypto/)
- [Threat model](https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/threat_model/)
- [2017 security audit](https://defuse.ca/audits/gocryptfs.htm), [Audit report as PDF](https://defuse.ca/downloads/audits/gocryptfs-cryptography-design-audit.pdf)
- [Gocryptfs source code](https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs)

To use gocryptfs on the HPC platform you need to do the following steps:

#### 1. Load gocryptfs profile from the modules system

```bash
(node)$> module load tools/gocryptfs
```

#### 2. Create two folders 
   - `dir.crypt`, which will act as the storage for the encrypted files (let’s call it *crypt*)
   - `dir`, which will present (on demand) the unencrypted view (let’s call it *view*)

```bash
(node)$> cd $SCRATCH/data_management
(node)$> mkdir dir.crypt dir
```

#### 3. Initialize the *crypt* folder with a password

```bash
(node)$> gocryptfs -init dir.crypt
Choose a password for protecting your files.
Password: 
Repeat: 

Your master key is:

e1ecdcf1-6bcebaa0-cbe6cfb8-8e27d4ad-
acefb9d4-bd98de59-311d1898-31d7e4e4

If the gocryptfs.conf file becomes corrupted or you ever forget your password, there is only one hope for recovery: The master key. Print it to a piece of paper and store it in a drawer. This message is only printed once.

The gocryptfs filesystem has been created successfully.
You can now mount it using: gocryptfs dir.crypt MOUNTPOINT
    
(node)$> ls dir.crypt/
gocryptfs.conf  gocryptfs.diriv
(node)$> ls dir
```

On *crypt* store initialization, gocryptfs provides us with the master key that can be used to restore access to the data files, especially useful in case the password is lost.

You should keep the master key safe, never store it unencrypted on the platform itself!

After initialization, the *crypt* store contains two internal configuration files: 

* `gocryptfs.conf` is the global configuration for the *crypt* store, while 

* `gocryptfs.diriv` is created per-directory for encryption of file names

Note that you should never modify (any) files within the *crypt* store.

#### 4. Mount the *crypt* folder into the *view* folder

To be able to access/store data, the *crypt* store needs to be mounted in the *view* folder    

- this can be done by supplying the initially set password, either on the command line or from a file with `-passfile` option
- … or with the generated master key, with the `-masterkey` option
- with the passfile option, it means that you have stored your  password unencrypted on the filesystem - this is then a security risk!
- when using the master key mode, you should be in a full-node or exclusive job reservation such that there are no other users able to  see the master key in the system

```bash
(node)$> gocryptfs dir.crypt dir
Password: 
Decrypting master key
Filesystem mounted and ready.
(node)$> ls dir
```

#### 5. Add files to the *view* folder
All your processing (new file/folder creation, modification and transfers) will happen in the *view* folder.

Once the *crypt* store is mounted in the *view* directory we can create files in the latter:    

- any folder/file created in the unencrypted view will have a 1:1 correspondent in the *crypt* store
- the plain text `message.txt` file is stored in encrypted format as `5o_WSYN-Tn59W3vrPiHXEA` in the underlying *crypt* store (file name metadata is encrypted as well)
- the same permissions applied on `message.txt` are also set for its encrypted correspondent file

```bash
(node)$> echo "Happy secure computing" > dir/message.txt
(node)$> ls dir
message.txt
(node)$> ls dir.crypt/
5o_WSYN-Tn59W3vrPiHXEA  gocryptfs.conf  gocryptfs.diriv
```

#### 6. Unmount the *view* folder

At the end of our processing, we are using `fusermount` explicitly to unmount the encrypted overlay, such that the unencrypted view of your data is closed and data is flushed to the regular filesystem.

Note that you should always ensure that this happens before your job reservation expires.

```bash
(node)$> fusermount -u dir
(node)$> ls dir
(node)$> ls dir.crypt/
5o_WSYN-Tn59W3vrPiHXEA  gocryptfs.conf  gocryptfs.diriv
```

#### Other important details

- Data stored in a *crypt* store should not be used concurrently (e.g. by multiple users at the same time). The [special option](https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/blob/master/Documentation/MANPAGE.md#-sharedstorage) `-sharedstorage` exists for this use-case, but is not guaranteed to work for all applications.

- (Parallel) Applications ran through `srun`  on the Iris cluster cannot "see" the unencrypted *view* folder as they are run in a different context.   

  This is also the case if you use `sjoin` or `srun --jobid` to attach your terminal to a running job.

#### Gocryptfs store password management

You can change the password of an existing *crypt* store with the `-passwd` option:

```bash
(node)$> gocryptfs -passwd dir.crypt/
Password: [your current password here]
Decrypting master key
Please enter your new password.
Password: [your new password here]
Repeat: [your new password here]
Password changed.
```

Note that the master key *does not change*.

For running batch processing on a gocryptfs-based folder, you can provide the decryption password through an external application with the `-extpass` option:

```bash
(node)$> gocryptfs -extpass "echo foobar" dir.crypt dir
Reading password from extpass program
Decrypting master key
Filesystem mounted and ready.
```

Note that this means that another application stores/has access to the password - this is then a security risk!
