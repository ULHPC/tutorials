# Scalable Science and Parallel computations with OpenMP/MPI

     Copyright (c) 2013-2021 UL HPC Team  <hpc-sysadmins@uni.lu>

[![](https://github.com/ULHPC/tutorials/raw/devel/parallel/basics/cover_slides.png)](https://github.com/ULHPC/tutorials/raw/devel/parallel/basics/slides.pdf)

When granted access to the [UL HPC](https://hpc.uni.lu) platform you will have at your disposal **parallel computing** resources.

Thus you will be able to run:

* ideally **parallel** (OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, OpenCL...) jobs
* however if your workflow involves **serial** tasks/jobs, you must run them *efficiently*

The objective of this tutorial is to show you how to run your OpenMP and/or [hybrid] MPI applications on top of the [UL HPC](https://hpc.uni.lu) platform.

For all the executions we are going to perform in this tutorial, you probably want to monitor the parallel execution on one of the allocated nodes. To do that, and **assuming** you have reserved computing resources or have a passive job running (see below):

* open **another** terminal (or another `tmux/screen` window  -- see ) as you'll want to monitor the execution.
* Connect to the allocated node with `sjoin <jobid> <nodename)`
* **For this new terminal/window**
    - run `htop`
        * press 'u' to filter by process owner, select your login
        * press 'F5' to enable the tree view

Note that there are other more advanced ways and tools to monitor parallel executions over OpenMP/MPI that are covered in [another tutorial](../../debugging/advanced/).


Finally, and this is especially true for hydrid OpenMP/MPI code, remember that you should **always align resource specs with physical NUMA characteristics**

* _Ex (AION): 16 cores per socket, 8 sockets ("physical" CPUs) per node_ (128c/node)
    - `[-N <N>] --ntasks-per-node <8n> --ntasks-per-socket <n> -c <thread>`
         * _Total_: `<N>`$\times 8\times$`<n>` tasks, each on `<thread>` threads, **Ensure** `<n>`$\times$`<thread>`= 16 on aion **if you target a full node utilisation**
         * Ex: `-N 2 --ntasks-per-node 32 --ntasks-per-socket 4 -c 4` (_Total_: 64 tasks)
* _Ex (IRIS): 14 cores per socket, 2 sockets ("physical" CPUs) per node_ (28c/node)
    - `[-N <N>] --ntasks-per-node <2n> --ntasks-per-socket <n> -c <thread>`
         * _Total_: `<N>`$\times 2\times$`<n>` tasks, each on `<thread>` threads,  **Ensure** `<n>`$\times$`<thread>`= 14 on iris **if you target a full node utilisation**
         * Ex: `-N 2 --ntasks-per-node 4 --ntasks-per-socket 2  -c 7` (_Total_: 8 tasks)


--------------------
## Pre-requisites ##

Ensure you are able to [connect to the UL HPC clusters](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/connect/access/).
In particular, recall that the `module` command **is not** available on the access frontends. **For all tests and compilation, you MUST work on a computing node**

Now you'll need to pull the latest changes in your working copy of the [ULHPC/tutorials](https://github.com/ULHPC/tutorials) you should have cloned in `~/git/github.com/ULHPC/tutorials` (see ["preliminaries" tutorial](../../preliminaries/))

``` bash
(access)$> cd ~/git/github.com/ULHPC/tutorials
(access)$> git pull
```

Now **configure a dedicated directory `~/tutorials/OpenMP-MPI` for this session**

``` bash
# return to your home
(access)$> mkdir -p ~/tutorials/OpenMP-MPI/bin
(access)$> cd ~/tutorials/OpenMP-MPI
# create a symbolic link to the top reference material
(access)$> ln -s ~/git/github.com/ULHPC/tutorials/parallel ref.d
$> ln -s ~/git/github.com/ULHPC/tutorials/parallel ref.d  # Symlink to the **root** reference parallel tutorial
$> ln -s ref.d/basics .   # Basics instructions
$> cd basics
```

**Advanced users** (_eventually_ yet __strongly__ recommended), create a [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) session (see [Tmux cheat sheet](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/) and [tutorial](https://www.howtogeek.com/671422/how-to-use-tmux-on-linux-and-why-its-better-than-screen/)) or [GNU Screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) session you can recover later. See also ["Getting Started" tutorial ](../../beginners/).

``` bash
# /!\ Advanced (but recommended) best-practice:
#     Always work within a TMux or GNU Screen session named '<topic>' (Adapt accordingly)
(access-aion)$> tmux new -s HPC-school   # Tmux
(access-iris)$> screen -S HPC-school     # GNU Screen
#  TMux     | GNU Screen | Action
# ----------|------------|----------------------------------------------
#  CTRL+b c | CTRL+a c   | (create) creates a new Screen window. The default Screen number is zero.
#  CTRL+b n | CTRL+a n   | (next) switches to the next window.
#  CTRL+b p | CTRL+a p   | (prev) switches to the previous window.
#  CTRL+b , | CTRL+a A   | (title) rename the current window
#  CTRL+b d | CTRL+a d   | (detach) detaches from a Screen -
# Once detached:
#   tmux ls  | screen -ls : list available screen
#   tmux att | screen -x  : reattach to a past screen
```

--------------------------
## Parallel OpenMP Jobs ##

[OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) (Open Multi-Processing) is a popular parallel programming model for multi-threaded applications. More precisely, it is an Application Programming Interface (API) that supports **multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing** programming in C, C++, and Fortran on most platforms, instruction set architectures and operating systems.

* [Reference website](https://www.openmp.org/): <https://www.openmp.org/>
* __Latest version: 5.2__ (Nov 2021) -- [specifications](https://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/OpenMP-API-Specification-5-2.pdf)
* Below notes are adapted from [LLNL OpenMP tutorial](https://hpc.llnl.gov/tuts/openMP/)

[OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) is designed for multi-processor/core, shared memory machine (nowadays NUMA). OpenMP programs accomplish parallelism **exclusively** through the use of threads.

* A __thread__ of execution is the smallest unit of processing that can be scheduled by an operating system.
    - Threads exist within the resources of a _single_ process. Without the process, they cease to exist.
* Typically, the number of threads match the number of machine processors/cores -- see [Resource Allocation](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/slurm/#specific-resource-allocation)
    - _Reminder_:
    **[aion](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/systems/aion/compute/)** compute nodes **MUST** be seen as **8 (virtual) processors of 16 cores each**, even if physically the nodes are hosting 2 physical sockets of [AMD Epyc ROME 7H12](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7h12) processors having 64 cores each (total: 128 cores per node).
    **[iris](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/systems/iris/compute/)**:  compute nodes typically hosts 2 physical processors of 14 cores each (total: 28 cores per nodes). The exception are the bigmem nodes (4 physical processors of 28 cores each, total 112 cores per nodes)
    - However, the actual _use_ of threads is up to the application.
    - `OMP_NUM_THREADS` (if present) specifies _initially_ the _max_ number of threads;
        * you can use `omp_set_num_threads()` to override the value of `OMP_NUM_THREADS`;
        * the presence of the `num_threads` clause overrides both other values.
* OpenMP is an explicit (not automatic) programming model, offering the programmer full control over parallelization.
    - parallelization can be as simple as taking a serial program and inserting compiler directives....
    - in general, this is way more complex

* OpenMP uses the fork-join model of parallel execution
    - **FORK**: the master thread then creates a team of parallel threads.
        * The statements in the program that are enclosed by the parallel region construct are then executed in parallel among the various team threads.
    - **JOIN**: When the team threads complete the statements in the parallel region construct, they synchronize and terminate, leaving only the master thread.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Fork_join.svg)

### Slurm reservations for OpenMP programs

* (eventually as this is the default but recommended to **always** specify to ensure you know what you're doing) set a _single_ task per node with `--ntasks-per-node=1`
* Use `-c <N>` (or `--cpus-per-task <N>`) to set the number of OpenMP threads you wish to use.
* (again) **The number of threads should not exceed the number of cores on a compute node.**

Thus a minimal [Slurm launcher for OpenMP](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/slurm/launchers/#pthreadsopenmp-launcher) would typically look like that -- see also [our default Slurm launchers](https://github.com/ULHPC/launcher-scripts/blob/devel/slurm/launcher.default.sh).

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1 # Run a single task per node, more explicit than '-n 1'
#SBATCH -c 28               # on iris: number of CPU cores i.e. OpenMP threads per task
###SBATCH -c 128            # on aion (remove first '##' and top line)
#SBATCH --time=0-01:00:00
#SBATCH -p batch

print_error_and_exit() { echo "***ERROR*** $*"; exit 1; }
module purge || print_error_and_exit "No 'module' command"
module load toolchain/foss    # or toolchain/intel

export SRUN_CPUS_PER_TASK=${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK}
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK:-1}
OPTS=$*

srun /path/to/your/threaded.app ${OPTS}
```

### OpenMP Compilation

| __Toolchain__     | __Compilation command (C)__ | __Compilation command (C++)__ |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `toolchain/intel` | `icc -qopenmp [...]`        | `icpc -qopenmp [...]`         |
| `toolchain/foss`  | `gcc -fopenmp [...]`        | `g++  -fopenmp [...]`         |

### Hands-on: OpenMP Helloworld and matrix multiplication

You can find in `src/hello_openmp.c` the traditional OpenMP "Helloworld" example.

* Reserve an interactive job to launch 4 OpenMP threads (for 30 minutes)

```bash
(access)$> si -c 4 -t 0:30:00
$> export OMP_NUM_THREADS=${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK:-1}
```

* Check the set variable `$OMP_NUM_THREADS`. Which value do you expect?

        $> echo $OMP_NUM_THREADS

* Check and compile the source `src/hello_openmp.c` to generate:
    - `bin/${ULHPC_CLUSTER}_hello_openmp`       (compiled over the `foss`  toolchain)
    - `bin/${ULHPC_CLUSTER}_intel_hello_openmp` (compiled over the `intel` toolchain)
    - indeed it's always a good practice to specify the supercomputer that was used to generate the binary. Use the global variable `${ULHPC_CLUSTER}` for that.

```bash
$> cat src/hello_openmp.c
######### foss toolchain
$> module purge                # Safeguard
$> module load toolchain/foss
$> gcc -fopenmp -Wall -O2 src/hello_openmp.c -o bin/${ULHPC_CLUSTER}_hello_openmp

######### intel toolchain
$> module purge                # Safeguard
$> module load toolchain/intel
$> icc -qopenmp -xhost -Wall -O2 src/hello_openmp.c -o bin/intel_${ULHPC_CLUSTER}_hello_openmp
```

* (__only__ if you have trouble to compile): `make omp`

* Execute the generated binaries multiple times. What do you notice?
* Exit your interactive session (`exit` or `CTRL-D`)
* Prepare a launcher script (use your favorite editor) to execute this application in batch mode -- adapt [pthreads/OpenMP template  Launcher](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/slurm/launchers/#pthreadsopenmp-launcher)

```bash
$> sbatch ./launcher.OpenMP.sh
```

Repeat the above procedure on a more serious computation: a naive matrix multiplication  using OpenMP, those source code is located in `src/matrix_mult_openmp.c`

Adapt the launcher script to sustain both executions (OpenMP helloworld and matrix multiplication)

_Note_: if you are lazy (or late), you can use the provided launcher script [`scripts/launcher.OpenMP.sh`](https://github.com/ULHPC/tutorials/blob/devel/parallel/basics/runs/launcher.OpenMP.sh).

```bash
$> ./scripts/launcher.OpenMP.sh -h
NAME
  launcher.OpenMP.sh: Generic OpenMP launcher
    Default APPDIR: /home/users/svarrette/tutorials/OpenMP-MPI/basics/bin
    Default APP: aion_hello_openmp
  Take the good habit to prefix the intel binaries (as foss toolchain is assumed by default)
  with 'intel_'

USAGE
  [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.OpenMP.sh [-n] {intel | foss } [app]
  EXE=/path/to/multithreadedapp.exe [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.OpenMP.sh [-n] {intel | foss }

OPTIONS:
  -n --dry-run: Dry run mode

Example:
  [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.OpenMP.sh                          # run FOSS  build   <cluster>_hello_openmp
  [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.OpenMP.sh intel                    # run intel build   intel_<cluster>_hello_openmp
  [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.OpenMP.sh foss matrix_mult_openmp  # run FOSS  build   matrix_mult_openmp
  EXE=/home/users/svarrette/bin/datarace [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.OpenMP.sh intel # run intel build  ~/bin/datarace
```

Now you can execute it:

```bash
$ ./scripts/launcher.OpenMP.sh
$ ./scripts/launcher.OpenMP.sh intel
$ ./scripts/launcher.OpenMP.sh foss ${ULHPC_CLUSTER}_matrix_mult_openmp
```

Passive jobs examples on aion:

```bash
$> sbatch -c 128 ./scripts/launcher.OpenMP.sh foss  ${ULHPC_CLUSTER}_matrix_mult_openmp
$> sbatch -c 128 ./scripts/launcher.OpenMP.sh intel ${ULHPC_CLUSTER}_matrix_mult_openmp
```

Check the elapsed time: what do you notice ?

### (optional) Hands-on: OpenMP data race benchmark suite

One way to test most of OpenMP feature is to evaluate its execution against a benchmark.
For instance, we are going to test OpenMP installation against  [DataRaceBench](https://github.com/LLNL/dataracebench), a benchmark suite designed to systematically and quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of data race detection tools.
It includes a set of microbenchmarks with and without data races. Parallelism is represented by OpenMP directives.

```bash
$> cd ~/git/github.com/ULHPC/tutorials/parallel/basics
$> make fetch      # clone src/dataracebench
$> cd src/dataracebench
```

Now you can reserve the nodes and set `OMP_NUM_THREADS`:

* Reserve an interactive job to launch a maximum of OpenMP threads on 1 node (for 1 hour)

```bash
# Example on Aion, 128 cores per node
(access)$> si --ntasks-per-node=1 -c 128 -t 1:00:00
$> export OMP_NUM_THREADS=${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK:-1}
```

* Open **another** terminal (or another `tmux/screen` window) to monitor the execution (see intructions on top).

* Execute the benchmark, for instance using the intel toolchain:

```bash
$> module load toolchain/intel
$> ./check-data-races.sh --help

Usage: ./check-data-races.sh [--run] [--help] language

--help      : this option
--small     : compile and test all benchmarks using small parameters with Helgrind, ThreadSanitizer, Archer, Intel inspector.
--run       : compile and run all benchmarks with gcc (no evaluation)
--run-intel : compile and run all benchmarks with Intel compilers (no evaluation)
--helgrind  : compile and test all benchmarks with Helgrind
--tsan-clang: compile and test all benchmarks with clang ThreadSanitizer
--tsan-gcc  : compile and test all benchmarks with gcc ThreadSanitizer
--archer    : compile and test all benchmarks with Archer
--coderrect : compile and test all benchmarks with Coderrect Scanner
--inspector : compile and test all benchmarks with Intel Inspector
--romp      : compile and test all benchmarks with Romp
--llov    : compile and test all benchmarks with LLVM OpenMP Verifier (LLOVE)
--customize : compile and test customized test list and tools

$> ./check-data-races.sh --run-intel C
```

## Parallel/Distributed MPI Jobs ##


The _Message Passing Interface_ (MPI) Standard  is a message passing library standard based on the consensus of the MPI Forum.
The goal of the Message Passing Interface is to establish a **portable**, **efficient**, and **flexible** standard for message passing that will be widely used for writing message passing programs.
MPI is not an IEEE or ISO standard, but has in fact, become the "industry standard" for writing message passing programs on HPC platforms.

* [Reference website](https://www.mpi-forum.org/): <https://www.mpi-forum.org/>
* __Latest version: 4.0__ (June 2021) -- [specifications](https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-4.0/mpi40-report.pdf)
* Below notes are adapted from [LLNL MPI tutorial](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/mpi/)

In the MPI programming model, a computation comprises one or more **processes** that communicate by calling library routines to send and receive messages to other processes.
In most MPI implementations,   a fixed set of processes is created at program initialization, and one process is created per processor.

### MPI implementations

The [UL HPC platform](https://hpc.uni.lu) offers to you different MPI implementations:

| __MPI Suite__                                                   | `module load`...  | __Compiler (C)__ | __Compiler (C++)__ |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| [Intel MPI](http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mpi-library/) | `toolchain/intel` | `mpiicc [...]`   | `mpiicpc [...]`    |
| [OpenMPI](http://www.open-mpi.org/)                             | `mpi/OpenMPI`     | `mpicc  [...]`   | `mpic++  [...]`    |


### MPI compilation

| __MPI Suite__ | __Example Compilation command__                        |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Intel MPI     | `{mpiicc/mpiicpc} -Wall [-qopenmp] [-xhost] -O2 [...]` |
| OpenMPI       | `{mpicc/mpic++}   -Wall [-fopenmp] -O2 [...]`          |

Of course, it is possible to have **hybrid** code, mixing MPI and OpenMP primitives.

### Slurm reservations and usage for MPI programs

* set the number of distributed nodes you want to reserver with `-N <N>`
* set the number of **MPI processes** per node (that's more explicit) with `--ntasks-per-node=<N>`
     - you can also use `-n <N>` to specify the _total_ number of MPI processes you want, but the above approach is advised.
* (eventually as this is the default) set a _single_ thread per MPI process  with `-c 1`
     - _except_ when running an hybrid code...

**Important**:

* To run your MPI program, be aware that Slurm is able to directly launch MPI tasks and initialize of MPI communications via [Process Management Interface (PMI)](https://slurm.schedmd.com/mpi_guide.html) and [PMIx](https://openpmix.github.io/)
     - permits to resolve the task affinity by the scheduler (avoiding to use `mpirun --map-by [...]`)
* Simply use (whatever MPI flavor you use):

            srun -n $SLURM_NTASKS /path/to/mpiprog [...]

Thus a **minimal launcher for OpenMPI** would _typically_ look like that -- see [MPI template  Launcher](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/slurm/launchers/#mpi)

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH -N 2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node 128    # MPI processes per node - use 28 on iris
#SBATCH -c 1
#SBATCH --time=0-01:00:00
#SBATCH -p batch

print_error_and_exit() { echo "***ERROR*** $*"; exit 1; }
module purge || print_error_and_exit "No 'module' command"
module load toolchain/foss
module load mpi/OpenMPI
OPTS=$*

srun -n $SLURM_NTASKS /path/to/your/openmpi.app ${OPTS}
```

In the above example, 2x128 = 256 MPI processes will be launched (matches Aion configuration). **You will have to adapt it for running on Iris**.

### Hands-on: MPI Helloworld and matrix multiplication

You can find in `src/hello_mpi.c` the traditional MPI "Helloworld" example.

* Reserve an interactive job to launch 6 MPI processes across two nodes 2x3 (for 30 minutes)

```bash
(access)$> si -N 2 --ntasks-per-node=3 -t 0:30:00
```

* Check and compile the source `src/hello_mpi.c` to generate:
    - `bin/openmpi_hello_mpi`  (compiled with the `mpi/OpenMPI` module)
    - `bin/intel_hello_mpi`    (compiled over the `intel` toolchain and Intel MPI)
<!--    - `bin/mvapich2_hello_mpi` (compiled over the `mpi/MVAPICH2` toolchain) -->

```bash
$> cat src/hello_mpi.c
######### OpenMPI
$> module purge                # Safeguard
$> module load mpi/OpenMPI
$> mpicc -Wall -O2 src/hello_mpi.c -o bin/openmpi_${ULHPC_CLUSTER}_hello_mpi

######### Intel MPI
$> module purge                # Safeguard
$> module load toolchain/intel
$> mpiicc -Wall -xhost -O2 src/hello_mpi.c -o bin/intel_${ULHPC_CLUSTER}_hello_mpi
```

* (__only__ if you have trouble to compile): `make mpi`
* Execute the generated binaries multiple times. What do you notice?
* Exit your interactive session (`exit` or `CTRL-D`)
* Prepare a launcher script (use your favorite editor) to execute this application in batch mode -- -- adapt [MPI template  Launcher](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/slurm/launchers/#mpi)

```bash
$> sbatch ./launcher.MPI.sh
```

Repeat the above procedure on a more serious computation: a naive matrix multiplication  using MPI, those source code is located in `src/matrix_mult_mpi.c`

Adapt the launcher script to sustain both executions (MPI helloworld and matrix multiplication)

_Note_: if you are lazy (or late), you can use the provided launcher script [`scripts/launcher.MPI.sh`](https://github.com/ULHPC/tutorials/blob/devel/parallel/basics/runs/launcher.MPI.sh).


```bash
$ ./scripts/launcher.MPI.sh -h
NAME
  launcher.MPI.sh: Generic MPI launcher
    Default APPDIR: /Users/svarrette/tutorials/OpenMP-MPI/basics/bin
    Default APP: _hello_mpi
  Take the good habit to prefix the binary to execute with MPI suit used for
  the build. Here the default MPI application run would be
        EXE=/Users/svarrette/tutorials/OpenMP-MPI/basics/bin/openmpi__hello_mpi
  which will be run as     srun -n $SLURM_NTASKS [...]

USAGE
  [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.MPI.sh [-n] {intel | openmpi | mvapich2} [app]
  EXE=/path/to/mpiapp.exe [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.MPI.sh [-n] {intel | openmpi | mvapich2}

OPTIONS:
  -n --dry-run: Dry run mode

Example:
  [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.MPI.sh                          # run OpenMPI build    openmpi_<cluster>_hello_mpi
  [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.MPI.sh intel                    # run Intel MPI build  intel_<cluster>_hello_mpi
  [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.MPI.sh openmpi matrix_mult_mpi  # run OpenMPI build    openmpi_matrix_mult_mpi
  EXE=/Users/svarrette/bin/xhpl [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.MPI.sh intel # run intel build  ~/bin/xhpl
```

Now you can execute it:

```bash
$ ./scripts/launcher.MPI.sh
$ ./scripts/launcher.MPI.sh intel
$ ./scripts/launcher.MPI.sh ${ULHPC_CLUSTER}_matrix_mult_mpi
$ ./scripts/launcher.MPI.sh intel ${ULHPC_CLUSTER}_matrix_mult_mpi
```


Passive jobs examples:

```bash
$ sbatch --ntasks-per-node 128 ./scripts/launcher.MPI.sh openmpi
$ sbatch --ntasks-per-node 128 ./scripts/launcher.MPI.sh intel   ${ULHPC_CLUSTER}_matrix_mult_mpi
```

## Hybrid OpenMP+MPI Programs ##

Of course, you can have _hybrid_ code mixing MPI and OpenMP primitives.

* You need to compile the code with the `-qopenmp` (with Intel MPI) or `-fopenmp` (for the other MPI suits) flags
* You need to adapt the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable accordingly
    - you need to adapt the value `-c <N>` (or `--cpus-per-task <N>`) to set the number of OpenMP threads you wish to use per MPI process
    - try to inherit from the Slurm allocation (and provide a meaningfull default value): `export OMP_NUM_THREADS=${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK:-1}`
* For best performances, you **MUST** align resource specs with physical NUMA characteristics -- see [ULHPC Technical documentation on Slurm Resource Allocation](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/slurm/#specific-resource-allocation)
    - **[aion](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/systems/aion/compute/)** compute nodes **MUST** be seen as **8 (virtual) processors of 16 cores each**, even if physically the nodes are hosting 2 physical sockets of [AMD Epyc ROME 7H12](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7h12) processors having 64 cores each (total: 128 cores per node).
    - **[iris](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/systems/iris/compute/)** compute nodes typically hosts 2 physical processors of 14 cores each (total: 28 cores per nodes). The exception are the bigmem nodes (4 physical processors of 28 cores each, total 112 cores per nodes).

Other misc considerations:

* You need to ensure the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is shared across the nodes
* (_Intel MPI only_) you probably want to set [`I_MPI_PIN_DOMAIN=omp`](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/mpi-developer-reference-linux/top/environment-variable-reference/process-pinning/interoperability-with-openmp-api.html)
* Like any MPI execution, simply use for whatever MPI flavor you use:

         srun -n $SLURM_NTASKS /path/to/hybrid [...]

Thus a **minimal launcher for hybrid OpenMP/MPI** would _typically_ look like that -- see [Hybrid OpenMP+MPI template Launcher](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/slurm/launchers/#hybrid-intel-mpiopenmp-launcher)

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l     # Multi-node hybrid application IntelMPI+OpenMP launcher
#SBATCH -N 2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node   8    # MPI processes per node - use 2 on iris
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-socket 1    # MPI processes per [virtual] processor
#SBATCH -c 16                    # OpenMP threads per MPI process - use 14 on iris
#SBATCH --time=0-01:00:00
#SBATCH -p batch

print_error_and_exit() { echo "***ERROR*** $*"; exit 1; }
module purge || print_error_and_exit "No 'module' command"
module load mpi/OpenMPI   # or toolchain/intel
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK:-1}
OPTS=$*

srun -n $SLURM_NTASKS /path/to/your/parallel-hybrid-app ${OPTS}
```

In the above example, 2x8 = 16 MPI processes will be launched, each with 16 OpenMP threads (to match Aion configuration). **You will have to adapt it for running on Iris**.

### Hands-on: Hybrid OpenMP+MPI Helloworld

You can find in `src/hello_hybrid.c` the traditional OpenMP+MPI "Helloworld" example.

* Reserve an interactive job to launch 2 MPI processes (1 per node), each composed of 4 OpenMP threads (for 30 minutes)

```bash
(access)$ si -N 2 --ntasks-per-node=1 -c 4 -t 0:30:00
$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK:-1}
```

* Check the set variable `$OMP_NUM_THREADS`. Which value do you expect?

        $> echo $OMP_NUM_THREADS

* Check and compile the source `src/hello_hybrid.c` to generate:
    - `bin/openmpi_hello_hybrid`  (compiled with the `mpi/OpenMPI` module)
    - `bin/intel_hello_hybrid`    (compiled over the `intel` toolchain and Intel MPI)
   <!-- - `bin/mvapich2_hello_hybrid` (compiled over the `mpi/MVAPICH2` toolchain) -->

```bash
$> cat src/hello_hybrid.c
######### OpenMPI
$> module purge                # Safeguard
$> module load mpi/OpenMPI
$> mpicc -fopenmp -Wall -O2 src/hello_hybrid.c -o bin/openmpi_${ULHPC_CLUSTER}_hello_hybrid

######### Intel MPI
$> module purge                # Safeguard
$> module load toolchain/intel
$> mpiicc -qopenmp -Wall -xhost -O2 src/hello_hybrid.c -o bin/intel_${ULHPC_CLUSTER}_hello_hybrid

```

* (__only__ if you have trouble to compile): `make hybrid`
* Execute the generated binaries (see above tips)
* Exit your interactive session (`exit` or `CTRL-D`)
* Adapt the MPI launcher to allow for batch jobs submissions over hybrid programs

```bash
$> sbatch ./launcher.hybrid.sh
```

_Note_: if you are lazy (or late), you can use the provided launcher script [`runs/launcher.hybrid.sh`](https://github.com/ULHPC/tutorials/blob/devel/parallel/basics/runs/launcher.hybrid.sh).


```bash
$ ./scripts/launcher.hybrid.sh -h
NAME
  launcher.hybrid.sh: Generic Hybrid OpenMP+MPI launcher
    Default APPDIR: /Users/svarrette/tutorials/OpenMP-MPI/basics/bin
    Default APP: _hello_hybrid
  Take the good habit to prefix the binary to execute with MPI suit used for
  the build. Here the default Hybrid OpenMP+MPI application run would be
        EXE=/Users/svarrette/tutorials/OpenMP-MPI/basics/bin/openmpi__hello_hybrid
  which will be run as     srun -n $SLURM_NTASKS [...]

USAGE
  [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.hybrid.sh [-n] {intel | openmpi | mvapich2} [app]
  EXE=/path/to/hydridapp.exe [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.hybrid.sh [-n] {intel | openmpi | mvapich2}

OPTIONS:
  -n --dry-run: Dry run mode

Example:
  [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.hybrid.sh                          # run hybrid OpenMPI build    openmpi_<cluster>_hello_hybrid
  [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.hybrid.sh intel                    # run hybrid Intel MPI build  intel_<cluster>_hello_hybrid
  [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.hybrid.sh openmpi matrix_mult      # run hybrid OpenMPI build    openmpi_matrix_mult
  EXE=/Users/svarrette/bin/hpcg [sbatch] ./scripts/launcher.hybrid.sh intel # run hybrid intel build ~/bin/hpcg
```

Now you can execute it:

```bash
$ ./scripts/launcher.hybrid.sh
$ ./scripts/launcher.hybrid.sh intel
```

Passive jobs examples:

```bash
# On Aion, you need to adapt the default settings
$> sbatch --ntasks-per-node 8 -c 16 ./scripts/launcher.hybrid.sh
$> sbatch --ntasks-per-node 8 -c 16 ./scripts/launcher.hybrid.sh intel
```

## Code optimization tips for your OpenMP and/or MPI programs ##

* Consider changing your memory allocation functions to avoid fragmentation and enable scalable concurrency support (this applies for OpenMP and/or MPI programs)
     - Facebook's [jemalloc](http://jemalloc.net/)
     - Google's [tcmalloc](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools)

* When using the `intel` toolchain:
     -  see the [Step by Step Performance Optimization with Intel(c) C++ Compiler](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/step-by-step-optimizing-with-intel-c-compiler)
         * the `-xhost` option permits to enable  processor-specific optimization.
         * you might wish to consider Interprocedural Optimization (IPO) approach, an automatic, multi-step process that allows the compiler to analyze your code to determine where you can benefit from specific optimizations.

---------------------
## Troubleshooting ##

* `srun: error: PMK_KVS_Barrier duplicate request from task ...`
   - you are trying to use `mpirun` (instead of `srun`) from Intel MPI within a SLURM session and receive such error on `mpirun`:  make sure `$I_MPI_PMI_LIBRARY` is **not** set (`unset I_MPI_PMI_LIBRARY``).
